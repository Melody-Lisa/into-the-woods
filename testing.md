## Automated Testing

This automated testing section contains all testing that has been run through a program to produce validation and performance insights.

### W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) was used to validate all HTML and CSS for the site via direct input. Each individual page was tested and final reconfiguration was carried out to ensure all results produced no errors.
